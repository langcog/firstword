I was briefly in another room, and when I came back the surprised guy said to me ""The baby said 'apple'"". I asked what he was doing at the time, and he said, still rather stunned, ""I was putting an apple on the table."" She had begun to say this word some time earlier when looking at a picture book and we had bought her some nesting wooden apples as well. Another very early word was 'owl', not what you would expect, either in terms of contrasts or referent, but she had a bag shaped like an owl that we kept her night clothes in. Words were used consistently and appropriately. She was a very early talker and had some little sentences at 13 months: ""It's a ant"" while pointing at a moving ant.",51,NA,NA,NA

This actually happened for my boy/girl twins at the same time, playing in the tub together and imitating me bouncing a duck along the tub ledge, saying ""quack quack quack"". I only considered it to be an actual word approximation once they began producing it without my first modeling the play behavior and word (i.e., they'd see the toy ducks and say ""gukguk""). I don't remember who said it independently first, and honestly it took a few weeks before I accepted that they'd begun producing their first word so the time of onset is approximate (I was a very skeptical parent, having encountered too many parents' untrustworthy reporting of first words). Also, my twins were born 5 1/2 weeks early, if that's relevant (I pretty much stopped adjusting their age by the time they turned 1).
